# Locals Block

- This block is used to keep frequently referenced values or expressions to keep the code clean and tidy.
- Locals block can hold many variables inside. Expressions in local values are not limited to literal constants. They can also reference other values in the module to transform or combine them. 
- These variables can be accessed using local.var_name notation


```

locals {
  service_name = "forum"
  owner        = "Community Team"
  instance_ids = concat(aws_instance.blue.*.id, aws_instance.green.*.id)
}


```
