# Locals Block


- A local value assigns a name to an expression, so you can use the name multiple times within a module instead of repeating the expression.
- Locals block can hold many variables inside.
- These variables can be accessed using local.var_name notation
- You can also combine local with variables, resource attributes, or other local values
- Terraform doesnâ€™t allow variable substitution within variables like 

```

var.env
var.projct 
var1 = var.env-var.project # not allowed 

```

- local can be useful here like 

```

variable "project_name" {
  type = string
}

variable "environment" {
  type = string
}

locals {
  name-prefix = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}"
}

```

- local can also be useful for refering complex code like 

```

locals {
  service_name = "forum"
  owner        = "Community Team"
  instance_ids = concat(aws_instance.blue.*.id, aws_instance.green.*.id)
}



```
