# Variable Block

- This block is called an input variable block. 
- Variable block provides parameters for terraform modules and allow users to customize the data provided to other terraform modules without modifying the source.
- Variables are often in their own file called variables.tf. 


```

variable "example_variable" {
  type = var_type
  description = var_description 
  default = value_1 
  sensitive = var_boolean_value 
}
