# Data Block

- Data block's primary purpose is to load or query data from APIs other than Terraform's.
- Data block's goal is to do something and then give you data.


```

data "aws_ami" "web" {
  filter {
    name   = "state"
    values = ["available"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "tag:Component"
    values = ["web"]
  }

  most_recent = true
}


```
