# Provider blocks


- Provider configurations belong in the root module of a Terraform configuration.
- Provider blocks specifies special type of module that allows Terraform to interact with various cloud-hosting platforms, cloud providers, SaaS providers, data-centers and other APIs.
- Providers must be configured with proper credentials before we can use them. 
- all Terraform configurations must declare which providers they require so that Terraform can install and use them.


```

provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 3.0"
  region = "us-east-1"
}


provider "google" {
  project = "acme-app"
  region  = "us-central1"
}

provider "aws" {
  region  = var.aws_region

  # You can use access keys
  access_key = var.aws_access_key
  secret_key = var.aws_secret_key

  # Or specify an aws profile, instead.
  # profile = "<aws profile>"
}
