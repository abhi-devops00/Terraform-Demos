# Module Block

- A module is a container for multiple resources that are used together.
- primary way to package and reuse resources in Terraform.
- A module can call other modules, which lets you include the child module's resources into the configuration in a concise way.


```

module "consul" {
  source  = "hashicorp/consul/aws"
  version = "0.0.5"

  servers = 3
}


```
