# Resource Block


- Resources are the most important element in the Terraform language.
- Resource blocks are used to manage resources such as compute instances, virtual networks, databases, buckets etc. 
- This block type is the backbone of any terraform configuration because it represents actual resources.


```

resource "aws_instance" "example_resource" {
  ami           = "ami-005e54dee72cc1d00" # us-west-2
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  credit_specification {
    cpu_credits = "unlimited"
  }
}


resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}



```


Meta-Arguments

>The Terraform language defines several meta-arguments, which can be used with any resource type to change the behavior of resources.

- depends_on         for specifying hidden dependencies
- count              for creating multiple resource instances according to a count
- for_each           to create multiple instances according to a map, or set of strings
- provider           for selecting a non-default provider configuration
- lifecycle          for lifecycle customizations
- provisioner        for taking extra actions after resource creation
