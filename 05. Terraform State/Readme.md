# What is Terraform state?


- Every time you run Terraform, it records information about what infrastructure it created in a Terraform state file in the same working directory 


# Work perform by state file?

- Every time you run Terraform, it can fetch the latest status of resource from AWS and compare that to whatâ€™s in your Terraform configurations to determine what changes need to be applied.


- In other words, the output of the plan command is a diff between the code on your computer and the infrastructure deployed in the real world.

** Never Ever edit the Terraform state files by hand or write code that reads them directly.

# Storging terraform.tfstate locally vs Remotely 

Terraform for a personal project, storing terraform state locally recommended.

But if you want to use Terraform as a team on a real product storing terraform state locally not recommended.



- To be able to use Terraform to update your infrastructure, each of your team members needs access to the same Terraform state files. 
That means you need to store those files in a shared location.

- Locking state files
If all the team member use the same terraform state file it need some mechanisum to lock multiple changes 

- Isolating state files 
for different env.
